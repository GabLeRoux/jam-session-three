Yet another micro-gamejam.

# Original Concept
2D sidescroller RTS (like those old flash games) where the player has to send commands in morse code to send out troups.

The player has morse code reference on their table and their morse code emitter. They can look up with binoculars to look at the state of the battle and turn back to their table to react accordingly.
